> Apply structured reasoning to specific knowledge. Not just answers, but *how we get to them*.


## 🛠️ Core Idea

**Reasoning on top of content.**  
We don’t just output facts—we structure the logic behind them.

The system:
- Maps logical steps (like decision trees or first-principles breakdowns).
- Applies domain-specific knowledge.
- Outputs structured reasoning paths.

## How to use it:
Example Prompt Use

    Input:
    Some patients with rheumatoid arthritis show complete remission despite high autoantibody titers. Why?

    Expected Model Output:

        Reduce known mechanisms of RA and role of antibodies.

        Identify this as an anomaly in standard immunopathology.

        Build a toy model with immune activation but no joint pathology.

        Consider metabolic, neural, or microbiome analogs.

        Invert: If remission is present, what suppresses inflammation despite antibodies?

        Suggest: There may be a parallel regulatory axis that silences inflammation regardless of antibody levels.

        Hypothesis: In certain RA patients, an upregulation of vagus nerve-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling overrides humoral autoimmunity.

        Test: Measure vagal tone markers in seropositive but asymptomatic RA patients.




##  Why in this way?

Current LLMs give you answers, but often the reasoning is opaque.  
We wanted to make the *thinking* visible:  
- Where did each step come from?  
- What assumptions were made?  
- How can we adjust/override them?
